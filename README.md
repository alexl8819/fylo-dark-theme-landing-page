## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - JS bundler

### What I learned

I took a different approach to this project by maximizing the use of max-widths to control the sizing of wrappers. I also took an iterative, 
step by step process to incrementally improve each section, focusing both on semantic HTML and accessiblity. By sticking to this process, 
I could ensure repeat views of the design spec would make my design match closely to the original. I hope to take this approach to newer projects
going forward.

### Continued development

I've incorporated eslint to ensure best practices are adhered to for cleaner and more reuseable code.
